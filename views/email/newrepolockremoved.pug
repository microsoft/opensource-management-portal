      h3 Legal Considerations
      p Legal issues often arise out of forked projects. In the general case:
      ul
        li
          strong Licensing.
          | Do not remove any copyright headers or license information. Do not change the license from the forked project without the permission of #[a(href='mailto:OSSStandardsLegal@service.microsoft.com') OSS CELA].
        li
          strong Modifications.
          | If you are modifying the project, follow our #[a(href=config.urls.docs) register] workflow for business/CELA approval.
        li
          strong Making a Fork #{config.brand.companyName}'s.
          | If you are making a "hard" fork that you plan on supporting as its own #{config.brand.companyName} project, follow our #[a(href=config.urls.release) release] workflow for business/CELA approval.
          ul: li
            strong Note:
            | the exception to this workflow for a fork is that the license must remain the same as the upstream fork. Contact #[a(href='mailto:OSSStandardsLegal@service.microsoft.com') OSS CELA] with questions.
        li
          strong Trademarks.
          | If you are making a "hard" fork of the project, there could be trademark implications around the continued use of the upstream project name. Contact #[a(href='mailto:OSSStandardsLegal@service.microsoft.com') OSS CELA] to discuss.
