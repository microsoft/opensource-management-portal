    li Must have a mechanism for receiving funds (the GitHub Sponsors team may be able to help)

    li People may also self-attest other contributions using #[a(href='https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/contributions/attestation') an attestation form].  Note: a linked GitHub account is still required for self-attestation.
