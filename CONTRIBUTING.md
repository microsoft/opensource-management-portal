## How to contribute code

Fixes to existing issues or small incremental improvements can be 
submitted as a pull request.

If you're looking to make a larger contribution, refactor code, or add 
a major new feature, please first open an issue to start communicating 
about the change with the maintainers. This will help to make the process 
smooth and lead to the most efficient model.

Changes should be small, incremental, and up-to-date with the upstream. 
Large long-term branches can lead to merge conflicts and reduced 
collaboration.

### Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repo on GitHub, cloning on your machine
2. Create a branch with your changes.
  - Please keep the branch specific to your contribution
  - Please use logical commits with helpful, concise commit messages
  - Follow the coding style of the project
  - Run follow any build or test scripts. Contribute new tests.
3. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with your contribution.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA) Requirement

This project requires that you have a signed Contributor License 
Agreement (CLA) with the copyright holder in order to have your 
contribution accepted.

The project may employ an automated pull request bot to review whether 
you have already signed a CLA or step you through the process. If it 
is not automated, you may need to sign the CLA on a separate site.

### Build, test and style requirements

This project may have continuous integration scripts, unit tests, 
code quality and linting tools, etc. that should be used as part 
of the contribution process.

If you are an active maintainer on this project, please feel free 
to submit a pull request updating this document with any specifics.

## Other ways to contribute

There are many other ways to get involved with the community and to 
participate in this project:

- Use the product, submitting GitHub issues when a problem is found
- Help code review pull requests and participate in issue threads
- Submit a new feature request as an issue
- Help answer questions on forums such as Stack Overflow
- Tell others about the project on Twitter, your blog, etc.

### Reporting issues

Issues unrelated to security should be submitted through this 
project's Issues tab on GitHub.

Please follow the following guidance when possible:

- Search or browse the existing issues to make sure the issue 
  has not already been reported
- Provide a detailed description of the issue including:
  - What feature the issue appears in
  - Under what circumstances the issue appears (your OS, environment 
    and build info)
  - What the desired behavior is
  - What the impact of the issue is
  - Any information that will be helpful to help reproduce the issue

We're excited to have a dialog and work together to make the 
project a success!

#### Reporting security issues and bugs

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the 
Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at 
[secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). You should receive 
a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow 
up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, 
including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).

## Attribution of changes

We do not want the source code to be full of random attributions. Git 
handles attribution by storing the committer information from changes 
and GitHub helps surface this information in its contributor graphs.

## Consistent source code headers

The license and copyright protections for this project's direct 
contributions should appear at the top of every source file.

If you contribute a change that includes a new source file, please 
take the time to make sure that the header is consistent with the 
rest of the project.

<!--
### Write Access

Write access is a very special privilege that is granted to project 
maintainers and contributions with a track record of substantial 
high-quality changes and community participation.

Even with write access, the code reviews and pull request process
should be used.
