# Features

There was an early thinking that "features" would provide feature-flag, independently-implemented
capabilities or sub-applications.

I don't think the design has really panned out. Open to feedback here.

## Organization sudo

> This feature is enabled by default but only lights up when orgs are configured for it.

Allows a set of users to have elevated privileges when using the portal. Helpful for
helping support a large organization with a set of trusted users configured at the organization
level to reduce persistent owner permissions.

[Review the sudo feature docs](sudo/sudo.md)

## Administrative features

### Manual linking

Allows an administrator to create links manually, for service accounts or other
purposes. To opt-in to this capability being available for system administrators,
set the `FEATURE_FLAG_ALLOW_ADMIN_MANUAL_LINKING` environment variable to `1`.
